            <h2>Important HTML Tags</h2>
            <article>
                <h3>&lt;!DOCTYPE html element&gt;</h3>
                Like said, the &lt;!DOCTYPE html element&gt; has to be in every html file. It helps browsers to display web pages correctly.
                In HTML5 you have to do &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;

                <h3>Headings</h3>
                A heading can start from &lt;h1&gt; to  &lt;h6&gt;. It signalizes something important.

                <h3>Paragraphs</h3>
                In HTML a Paragraph is defined with the &lt;p&gt; tag.

                <h3>Links</h3>
                Links are defined with &lt;a href = "URL"&gt;This is a link &lt;/a&gt; tag.

                <h3>Images</h3>
                The &lt;img&gt; is used to embed an image in an HTML page. The tag creates a holding space for the referenced image. The tag requires/has two attributes. src and alt.
                You can also directly specify the height and width of an image which is better, because the website may flicker.

                <h3>Head</h3>
                    The &lt;head&gt; is for metadata (data about data) and is placed between the &lt;html&gt; and &lt;body&gt; tag. Anything about the HTML document is there but it is not displayed.
                    Elements that can/should go inside the head element:
                    title,style,base,link,meta,script,noscript.
