       <h1>World Wide Web General</h1>
       <div class = "box">
           Web was invented by a English <Com></Com>puter Scientist Tim Berners-Lee at CERN.
           First proposal was written in 1989 and the system worked by the end of 1990 including
           the WWW Browser and an HTTP server.
           Technology was released outside of CERN to other research instotution.
           <p>What made the WWW such a success?</p>
           - CERN, WWW-Browser, HTTP/S, Java and Javascript, W3C, XML, HTML

       <h2>How does the Web works</h2>

       <div class = "box">
           To access the WWW or a local website a web client is used.
           The client retrieves content from resources that are stored on the webserver which is a
           computer that accepts HTTP and HTTPS requests and then graphically renders the requested page or sends an error
           message.
       </div>

       <h2>URL</h2>
       <div class = "box">
           A Uniform Resource Locator (URL), colloquially termed a web address,
           is a reference to a web resource that specifies its location on a computer network and
           a mechanism for retrieving it. The format combines the scheme followed by :// and the pre-existing
           system of domain names with file path syntax, where slashes are used to separate directory and filenames.
       </div>

       <h3>The general components of an URL</h3>
       <div class = "box">
           hypertext Transfer control (http/s); ://;
           World wide web (www); Domain name, Top level domain;
           Port number; path; (?) query; (#) fragment;
       </div>

       <h1>Web Server</h1>

       <div class = "box">
           A web servers is a computer software and underlying hardware that accepts
           requests via HTTP or HTTPS. The web server connects to the internet
           and supports physical data interchange with other devices connected to the web.

           On the hardware the web server software and website files will be stored.
           The contend in webpages are either static or dynamic.

           Known Application Server: Nginx, Apache
       </div>

       <h1>Web Client</h1>
       <div class="box">
           A web client is an application software for accessing the WWW or a local Website.
           When a User requests a webpage, the web browser retrieves it's files
           from a web server and graphically renders the page on the user's screen or it sends
           an error message.
           Webserver and Webbrowser sind Endpunkte.

           <br>
           <li>
               The difference between web client and web browser is, that the web client sends a
               request to the web server and the web browser inteprets and requests the html file/s.
           </li>
       </div>
       <h2>HTML & CSS</h2>
       <div class="box">
           HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is used to write the structure of a webpage (skeleton).
           CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) can be used to make the website look nicer.
           You can format text, position items and more.
           The &lt;html&gt; element is the root of an html document.
           It contains all other elements except for the &lt;!DOCTYPE html element&gt;
